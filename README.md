# Agent Based Performance Analysis of Strategic Algorithms in Prisoner’s Dilemma

## Description
To create a system that provides a comparison of multiple algorithms that may be tested in the Prisoner’s Dilemma
decision problem using two subjects in a dual agent environment. As an addition to understanding the effects of various
algorithms and logic that helps influence a single agent’s decision, our system aims at analysing the performance of the 
same algorithms in iterative and multi agent systems. The results are obtained by using concepts of Swarm Intelligence, 
Multiple Agent Systems and Super Agents within the testing system. The results of the research are to expose the advantages 
and disadvantages of each schema to help plan investments, predict outcomes and for real world application of the Prisoner’s
Dilemma in fields of Environmental Sciences, Psychology, Economics and many more such fields. <br>

## Experimentation and Findings
### Strategic Algorithms used
1. Tit-for-Tat (TFT)
2. Win-Stay, Lose-Switch (WSLS)
3. Generous Tit-for-Tat (GTFT)
4. Zero-Determinant GTFT (ZDGTFT)<br>

### Findings
1. After running a number of iterations of different algorithms in a two-agent environment of the problem considered, 
we found out that on an average Win-Stay Lose-Switch (WSLS) has the least execution time when the either one of
the agent decides to co-operate first.
The trend differs from the results on different iterations but the on an average WSLS Algorithm takes 0.002904333 secs 
which is the least when compared to other algorithms Win stay lose switch strategies stay with an action if it leads to
a satisfactory outcome. Hence, they do not necessarily maximize their payoff. This strategy has been very successful in 
the context of the iterated Prisoner‟s Dilemma. <br>

2. Considering the second case where one of the agent decides to defect in the first place. After running the existing 
algorithms discussed above on the second agent, 
it is found out that on an average Generous tit-for-tat algorithm runs with the
least execution time i.e. 0.003101533.
